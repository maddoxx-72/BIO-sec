Now explaining the code in brief:
import getpassThe getpass module in Python provides a way to read the user input without showing it on the display.
The getpass module can be used to get a password or other sensitive information from the user.
The getpass module in Python provides a way to securely read the user input without showing it on the
console. The getpass module can be used to get a password or other sensitive information from the user.
import numpy as npThe numpy module is a widely used Python library for numerical computations. It provides support for
multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to manipulate these arrays. It is widely
used in various scientific and engineering applications, such as data science, machine learning, signal processing, and more.
Import cvThe cv2 module is a Python wrap for the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) C++ library. It
provides a wide range of functions for image and video processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
Import osThe os module is a built-in Python module that provides a way to interact with the primary operating system. It provides a wide range of functions for working with files and dictionary, managing processes,and more.
Import mathThe math module is a built-in Python module that provides a range of mathematical functions and constants.
import randomThe random module is a built-in Python module that provides a range of functions for generating random numbers and sequences.
import smtplibThe smtplib module is a built-in Python module that provides a way to send emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
• SMTP Connection: smtplib provides a SMTP class that allows you to connect to an SMTP server and send emails using various methods.
• Authentication: smtplib supports various authentication mechanisms, such as plain text authentication and secure authentication using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssimThe skimage.metrics module is a part of the scikit-image library, which is a collection of algorithms for image processing in Python. The structural_similarity function in skimage.metrics is used to calculate the structural similarity index between two images.
The structural similarity index is a measure of the similarity between two images, considering luminance, contrast, and structure. It returns a value between -1 and 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the two images are identical, and a value of -1 indicates that the two images are completely dissimilar.
