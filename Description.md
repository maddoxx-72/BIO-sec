# BIO-sec


In this project we have a created a sample test scenario for 3FA with Biometrics.

1. First we simply enter your username along with your password in the designated fields. Once you've provided your credentials, the system will verify your information from the credentitals in the database to ensure a secure login.
2. After the login is sucessful, we ghet to the second level which is the One-Time-Password (OTP). which you'll receive in your gmail and it will only verify after you put the right credentials.
3. After its verified we reach the final security which is the Biometrics. In our case we used a fingerprint authentication which will match the live fingerprint with the saved fingerprint in the database.
